This random forest model aims to predict the species of a zebra (plains or Grevy's) based on environmental and behavioral characteristics of the sighting. Such characteristics include GPS coordinates, distance to water, animal activity, grass quality and height, weather conditions, and time of day. This model was a supplementary part of my thesis, "Understanding the Differences in How Grevy's and Plains Zebras Interact with Cattle," written for the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University. (The code was adapted from the course SML 301-Data Intelligence: Modern Data Science Methods taught by Professor Daisy Yan Huang)
